emudbg - emulator-agnostic source-level debugging API
Copyright (c) 2015-2021 Damien Ciabrini

emudbg defines a simple debugging API that can be implemented by
emulators to expose simple step-by-step execution and memory
inspection capabilities over a standard GDB remote serial protocol [1]

emudbg implements a generic RSP server that can be targeted by any
debugger implementing the GDB remote serial protocol. It controls
the execution of the emulated software by calling the debugging API
whose implementation has to be provided by the emulator.
